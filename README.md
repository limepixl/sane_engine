TODO:
* Batching
* Move over to own math lib (especially for matrix transformations)
* Experiment with quaternions
* Use JSON instead of own format for scene loading (Might be overkill)
* ~~Instanced rendering~~
* ~~Visible lights~~
* ~~Custom scene format that describes models lights and positions in the world~~
* ~~Move over to C file handling instead of C++'s <fstream>~~
* ~~Store uniform locations on startup instead of every time a uniform value is set~~
* ~~Have a global index count for textures because assigning random indices to them is hacky~~
